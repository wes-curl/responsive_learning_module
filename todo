Overhaul...                 You're gonna have to fix how values and     (16:41 08/31/2021)  (17:31 08/31/2021)
                                units are updated out of synch
                            Have it so that units change when the       (16:41 08/31/2021)  (17:31 08/31/2021)
                                variables describing them change.
                                You know the issue.
                            Make it so that the numbers are stored      (16:41 08/31/2021)  (17:31 08/31/2021)
                                outside of text. HTML fields
                                should be display only.
                            Also, add a listener to trigger the         (16:41 08/31/2021)  (17:31 08/31/2021)
                                updates. Use what you learned from
                                the ALM work - turned out to be
                                irrelevant

Tech tree                   When the XML/PHP is done, create a
                                framework to build entire lessons.
                            Make a model lesson out of modules
