Notes to self:


Todo:
general task                specific subtask(s)                         opened                closed (or status)  notes
Format text better          subtext (v_0)                               (__:__ __/__/____)    (__:__ __/__/____)  ____
                            supertext (v^2)
                            scientific notation in value display
                                (for numbers > 1000 and < 0.01)

Unit reform                 have computer shorten common units (m/s)?
                            add new unit conversions
                            add more supported units

Overhaul...                 You're gonna have to fix how values and 
                                units are updated out of synch
                            Have it so that units change when the
                                variables describing them change.
                                You know the issue.
                            Also, add a listener to trigger the 
                                updates. Use what you learned from
                                the ALM work

PHP                         create a PHP page to manage user work

XML                         create an XML schema to rapidly make new
                                RLM modules

functions                   Add function support!
                            Add sin, cos, tan, arccos, arctan, arcsin
                            Add multi-input function support!
                            Add user-defined functions?

Error handling              Have the computer catch user errors neatly
                            have those errors displayed cleanly

submission                  Add a submit button and a form
                            have it only available if a variable
                                named "answer" exists
                            respond to user errors?

CSS                         Format text
                            Format questions
                            Format page
                            Add flourishes
                            Add custom graphics (the good stuff)

Tech tree                   When the XML/PHP is done, create a
                                framework to build entire lessons.
                            Make a model lesson out of modules
